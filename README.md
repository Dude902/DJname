# djname
Looks for 3-4 syllable words on a page to turn into DJ names.

To run, copy and paste this as a bookmark and use it whenever (some site's security does not allow the script to run):

javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://dude902.github.io/DJname/3or4syllablesDJ.js';})();
